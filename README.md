# TAW2016 Hands-on Workshop

## Getting started

Create a workspace and choose the Github project as the base. The project is
at `https://github.com/SirIle/es2017-sequelize-demo.git`.

To initialize the Cloud9 workspace use the console to run

~~~bash
scripts/init.sh
~~~

The script will ask for a password when it's decrypting the Docker Datacenter
Client bundle, you will receive the password from the instructors.

After this try `docker ps` to check that the connection to Datacenter works.

## Things to do

TODO:
-   Configure the participant name based things, like database name and image & container name
-   Figure out a good hands-on change to the application
